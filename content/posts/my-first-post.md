Alrighty , lets get into it.

Suppose you wanna check the diff between two commits but only want the file names :

```javascript
 git diff e79c9cfd5c4a6d6a05c0a6a98a2c02c8b3695c78 a48280889774f5be78cc2817c7c8d541b02a600e --name-only
```


Suppose you wanna check the diff between two commits but only want the file names, but also you wanna exclude the deleted file :

```javascript
  git diff e79c9cfd5c4a6d6a05c0a6a98a2c02c8b3695c78 a48280889774f5be78cc2817c7c8d541b02a600e --name-only --diff-filter=M
```

Suppose you wanna check the diff between two commits but only want the file names, but also you wanna exclude the deleted file and only show the logs for a specific file type :

```javascript
  git diff e79c9cfd5c4a6d6a05c0a6a98a2c02c8b3695c78 a48280889774f5be78cc2817c7c8d541b02a600e --name-only --diff-filter=M -- '*.js'
```

For a slightly more advanced use case where you wanna compare the diff between 2 commits but want to exclude all the commits in between checkout this so thread [HERE](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1191282/how-to-see-the-changes-between-two-commits-without-commits-in-between).

Also for checking the actualy contents of the diff i use a plugin called [git lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) in VS code and it has a compare commits feature which give you a more comprehensive analysis/view then a simple `git diff <COMMIT ID> <COMMIT ID>`.

Hope this article was helpful. Cheers.
